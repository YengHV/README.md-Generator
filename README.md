# README.md-Generator
As a user, I am able to run node.js and a series of prompts will occur.
The first prompt will ask for Github username.
Then it will display avatar_url and email.
The next set of prompts will ask for information to put into a readme.md
The user's input will be taken
the input will be stored.
Onced stored, that data will be process and a new readme.md will be created.
# Ways to improve
figure out what function init does.
actually take user input and display it on the new text file. (currently can not add in user input)
